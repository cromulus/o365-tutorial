# Getting Started with the Outlook Mail API and Ruby on Rails #

[日本 (日本語)](https://github.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/blob/master/loc/readme-ja.md) (Japanese)

The purpose of this guide is to walk through the process of creating a simple Ruby on Rails app that accesses a user's data in Office 365 or Outlook.com. The source code in this repository is what you should end up with if you follow the steps outlined here.

## Before you begin ##

This guide assumes:

- That you already have Ruby on Rails installed and working on your development machine.
- That you have an Office 365 tenant, with access to an account in that tenant **OR** an Outlook.com developer preview account.

## Create the app ##

Let's dive right in! From your command line, change your directory to a directory where you want to create your new Ruby on Rails app. Run the following command to create an app called `o365-tutorial` (**Note:** feel free to change the name to whatever you want. For the purposes of this guide I will assume the name of the app is `o365-tutorial`.):

    rails new o365-tutorial

If you're familiar with Ruby on Rails, this is nothing new for you. If you're new to it, you'll notice that command creates an `o365-tutorial` sub-directory, which contains a number of files and directories. Most of these aren't important for our purposes, so don't worry too much about them.

On the command line, change your directory to the `o365-tutorial` sub-directory. Let's take a quick detour to verify that the app was created successfully. Run the following command:

    rails server

Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the default Ruby on Rails welcome page.

![The default Ruby on Rails welcome page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/master/readme-images/default-ruby-page.PNG)

Now that we've confirmed that Ruby on Rails is working, we're ready to do some real work.

## Designing the app ##

Our app will be very simple. When a user visits the site, they will see a link to log in and view their email. Clicking that link will take them to the Azure login page where they can login with their Office 365 or Outlook.com account and grant access to our app. Finally, they will be redirected back to our app, which will display a list of the most recent email in the user's inbox.

Let's begin by replacing the default welcome page with a page of our own. To do that, we'll modify the application controller, located in the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\application_controller.rb` file. Open this file in your favorite text editor. Let's define a `home` action that renders a very simple bit of HTML, as shown in the following listing:

### Contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\application_controller.rb` file ###

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
  # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
  
  def home
    # Display the login link.
    render html: '<a href="#">Log in and view my email</a>'.html_safe
  end
end
```
=======
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
      # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
      protect_from_forgery with: :exception

      def home
		# Display the login link.
    	render html: '<a href="#">Log in and view my email</a>'.html_safe
      end
    end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

As you can see, our home page will be very simple. For now, the link doesn't do anything, but we'll fix that soon. First we need to tell Rails to invoke this action. To do that, we need to define a route. Open the `.\o365-tutorial\config\routes.rb` file, and set the default route (or "root") to the `home` action we just defined.

### Contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\config\routes.rb` file ###

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'application#home'
end
```

Save your changes. Now browsing to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) should look like:

![The app's home page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/master/readme-images/home-page.PNG)

## Implementing OAuth2 ##

Our goal in this section is to make the link on our home page initiate the [OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant flow with Azure AD](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn645542.aspx). To make things easier, we'll use the [oauth2 gem](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2) to handle our OAuth requests. We'll also use the [activerecord-session_store gem](https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store) to store our sessions in a database. Open the `./o365-tutorial/GemFile` and add the following lines anywhere in that file:

    gem 'oauth2'
    gem 'activerecord-session_store'

Save the file and run the following command (restart the rails server afterwards):

    bundle install

Now let's configure the app to use the `activerecord-session_store` gem for session storage. The reason for this is that the default cookie store is limited to 4KB of data, which isn't enough for us to store the tokens we'll get back from Azure.

Open the `.\o365-tutorial\config\initializers\session_store.rb` file. Replace the text `:cookie_store` with `:active_record_store`.

On the command line, enter the following commands to generate the session database.

    rails generate active_record:session_migration
    rails db:migrate

Because of the nature of the OAuth2 flow, it makes sense to create a controller to handle the redirects from Azure. Run the following command to generate a controller named `Auth`:

    rails generate controller Auth

Open the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file. We'll start here by defining a function to generate the login URL.

### Contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file ###

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
module AuthHelper

  # App's client ID. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
  CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR APP ID HERE>'
  # App's client secret. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
  CLIENT_SECRET = '<YOUR APP PASSWORD HERE>'

  # Scopes required by the app
  SCOPES = [ 'openid',
             'https://outlook.office.com/mail.read' ]
  
  REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/authorize' # Temporary!

  # Generates the login URL for the app.
  def get_login_url
    client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
                                CLIENT_SECRET,
                                :site => 'https://login.microsoftonline.com',
                                :authorize_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize',
                                :token_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/token')
                              
    login_url = client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => REDIRECT_URI, :scope => SCOPES.join(' '))
  end
end
```
=======
    module AuthHelper

      # App's client ID. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
      CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR APP ID HERE>'
      # App's client secret. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
      CLIENT_SECRET = '<YOUR APP PASSWORD HERE>'

	  # Scopes required by the app
	  SCOPES = [ 'openid',
				 'https://outlook.office.com/mail.read' ]

      REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/authorize' # Temporary!

      # Generates the login URL for the app.
      def get_login_url
    	client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
	                                CLIENT_SECRET,
	                                :site => 'https://login.microsoftonline.com',
	                                :authorize_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize',
	                                :token_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/token')

    	login_url = client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => REDIRECT_URI, :scope => SCOPES.join(' '))
      end
    end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

The first thing we do here is define our client ID and secret, and the permission scopes our app requires. We also define a redirect URI as a hard-coded value. We'll improve on that in a bit, but it will serve our purpose for now. Now we need to generate values for the client ID and secret.

### Generate a client ID and secret ###

Head over to https://apps.dev.microsoft.com to quickly get a client ID and secret. Using the sign in buttons, sign in with either your Microsoft account (Outlook.com), or your work or school account (Office 365).

![The Application Registration Portal Sign In Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/master/readme-images/sign-in.PNG)

Once you're signed in, click the **Add an app** button. Enter `o365-tutorial` for the name and click **Create application**. After the app is created, locate the **Application Secrets** section, and click the **Generate New Password** button. Copy the password now and save it to a safe place. Once you've copied the password, click **Ok**.

![The new password dialog.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/master/readme-images/new-password.PNG)

Locate the **Platforms** section, and click **Add Platform**. Choose **Web**, then enter `http://localhost:3000/authorize` under **Redirect URIs**. Click **Save** to complete the registration. Copy the **Application Id** and save it along with the password you copied earlier. We'll need those values soon.

Here's what the details of your app registration should look like when you are done.

![The completed registration properties.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/master/readme-images/ruby-tutorial.PNG)

Once this is complete you should have a client ID and a secret. Replace the `<YOUR APP ID HERE>` and `<YOUR APP PASSWORD HERE>` placeholders with these values and save your changes.

### Back to coding ###

Now that we have actual values in the `get_login_url` function, let's put it to work. Modify the `home` action in the `ApplicationController` to use this method to fill in the link. You'll need to include the `AuthHelper` module to gain access to this function.

#### Updated contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\application_controller.rb` file ####

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
  # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
  include AuthHelper
  
  def home
    # Display the login link.
    login_url = get_login_url
    render html: "<a href='#{login_url}'>Log in and view my email</a>".html_safe
  end
end
```
=======
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
      # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
      protect_from_forgery with: :exception
      include AuthHelper

      def home
    	# Display the login link.
    	login_url = get_login_url
    	render html: "<a href='#{login_url}'>Log in and view my email</a>".html_safe
      end
    end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

Save your changes and browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you hover over the link, it should look like:

    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=<SOME GUID>&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauthorize&response_type=code&scope=openid+https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office.com%2Fmail.read

The `<SOME GUID>` portion should match your client ID. Click on the link and you should be presented with a sign in page:

![The Azure sign-in page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial/master/readme-images/azure-sign-in.PNG)

Sign in with your Office 365 account. Your browser should redirect to back to our app, and you should see a lovely error:

    No route matches [GET] "/authorize"

If you scroll down on Rails' error page, you can see the request parameters, which include the authorization code.

    Parameters:
	    {"code"=>"M2ff0cb19-ec9d-db94-c5ab-4c634e319315"}

The reason we're seeing the error is because we haven't implemented a route to handle the `/authorize` path we hard-coded as our redirect URI. However, Rails has shown us that we're getting the authorization code back in the request, so we're on the right track! Let's fix that error now.

### Exchanging the code for a token ###

First, let's add a route for the `/authorize` path to `routes.rb`.

#### Updated contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\config\routes.rb` file ####

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'application#home'
  get 'authorize' => 'auth#gettoken'
end
```

The added line tells Rails that when a GET request comes in for `/authorize`, invoke the `gettoken` action on the `auth` controller. So to make this work, we need to implement that action. Open the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\auth_controller.rb` file and define the `gettoken` action.

#### Contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\auth_controller.rb` file ####

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
class AuthController < ApplicationController

  def gettoken
    render text: params[:code]
  end
end
```
=======
    class AuthController < ApplicationController

      def gettoken
    	render text: params[:code]
      end
    end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

Let's make one last refinement before we try this new code. Now that we have a route for the redirect URI, we can remove the hard-coded constant in `auth_helper.rb`, and instead use the Rails name for the route: `authorize_url`.

#### Updated contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file ####

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
module AuthHelper

  # App's client ID. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
  CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR APP ID HERE>'
  # App's client secret. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
  CLIENT_SECRET = '<YOUR APP PASSWORD HERE>'

  # Scopes required by the app
  SCOPES = [ 'openid',
             'https://outlook.office.com/mail.read' ]

  # Generates the login URL for the app.
  def get_login_url
    client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
                                CLIENT_SECRET,
                                :site => "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
                                :authorize_url => "/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
                                :token_url => "/common/oauth2/v2.0/token")
                              
    login_url = client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => authorize_url, :scope => SCOPES.join(' '))
  end
end
```
=======
    module AuthHelper

      # App's client ID. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
      CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR APP ID HERE>'
      # App's client secret. Register the app in Application Registration Portal to get this value.
      CLIENT_SECRET = '<YOUR APP PASSWORD HERE>'

	  # Scopes required by the app
	  SCOPES = [ 'openid',
				 'https://outlook.office.com/mail.read' ]

      # Generates the login URL for the app.
      def get_login_url
    	client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
	                                CLIENT_SECRET,
	                                :site => "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
	                                :authorize_url => "/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
	                                :token_url => "/common/oauth2/v2.0/token")

    	login_url = client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => authorize_url, :scope => SCOPES.join(' '))
      end
    end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

Refresh your browser (or repeat the sign-in process). Now instead of a Rails error page, you should see the value of the authorization code printed on the screen. We're getting closer, but that's still not very useful. Let's actually do something with that code.

Let's add another helper function to `auth_helper.rb` called `get_token_from_code`.

#### `get_token_from_code` in the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file ####

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
# Exchanges an authorization code for a token
def get_token_from_code(auth_code)
  client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
                              CLIENT_SECRET,
                              :site => 'https://login.microsoftonline.com',
                              :authorize_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize',
                              :token_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/token')

  token = client.auth_code.get_token(auth_code,
                                     :redirect_uri => authorize_url,
                                     :scope => SCOPES.join(' '))
end
```

### Getting the user's email address ###

Our first use of the access token will be to get the user's email address from the Outlook API. You'll see why we want this soon.

Add a new function `get_user_email` to `auth_helper.rb`.

#### `get_user_email` in the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file ####

```ruby
# Gets the user's email from the /Me endpoint
def get_user_email(access_token)
  conn = Faraday.new(:url => 'https://outlook.office.com') do |faraday|
    # Outputs to the console
    faraday.response :logger
    # Uses the default Net::HTTP adapter
    faraday.adapter  Faraday.default_adapter  
  end

  response = conn.get do |request|
    # Get user's info from /Me
    request.url 'api/v2.0/Me'
    request.headers['Authorization'] = "Bearer #{access_token}"
    request.headers['Accept'] = 'application/json'
  end

  email = JSON.parse(response.body)['EmailAddress']
end
```
=======
    # Exchanges an authorization code for a token
    def get_token_from_code(auth_code)
      client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
                                  CLIENT_SECRET,
                                  :site => 'https://login.microsoftonline.com',
                                  :authorize_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize',
                                  :token_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/token')

      token = client.auth_code.get_token(auth_code,
                                         :redirect_uri => authorize_url,
                                         :scope => SCOPES.join(' '))
    end

### Getting the user's email address ###

The JSON array returned from `get_token_from_code` doesn't just include the access token. It also includes an ID token. We can use this token to find out a few pieces of information about the logged on user. In this case, we want to get the user's email address. You'll see why we want this soon.

Add a new function `get_email_from_id_token` to `auth_helper.rb`.

#### `get_email_from_id_token` in the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file ####

	# Parses an ID token and returns the user's email
	def get_email_from_id_token(id_token)

	  # JWT is in three parts, separated by a '.'
	  token_parts = id_token.split('.')
	  # Token content is in the second part
	  encoded_token = token_parts[1]

	  # It's base64, but may not be padded
	  # Fix padding so Base64 module can decode
	  leftovers = token_parts[1].length.modulo(4)
	  if leftovers == 2
	    encoded_token += '=='
	  elsif leftovers == 3
	    encoded_token += '='
	  end

	  # Base64 decode (urlsafe version)
	  decoded_token = Base64.urlsafe_decode64(encoded_token)

	  # Load into a JSON object
	  jwt = JSON.parse(decoded_token)

	  # Email is in the 'preferred_username' field
	  email = jwt['preferred_username']
	end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

Let's make sure that works. Modify the `gettoken` action in the `auth_controller.rb` file to use these helper functions and display the return values.

#### Updated contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\auth_controller.rb` file ####

<<<<<<< bbd75974af4fd5b2f3d652bf12e08eccda21707f
```ruby
class AuthController < ApplicationController

  def gettoken
    token = get_token_from_code params[:code]
    email = get_user_email token.token
    render text: "Email: #{email}, TOKEN: #{token.token}"
  end
end
```
=======
    class AuthController < ApplicationController

      def gettoken
    	token = get_token_from_code params[:code]
		email = get_email_from_id_token token.params['id_token']
    	render text: "Email: #{email}, TOKEN: #{token.token}"
      end
    end
>>>>>>> adding dotenv

If you save your changes and go through the sign-in process again, you should now see the user's email followed by a long string of seemingly nonsensical characters. If everything's gone according to plan, that should be an access token.

Now let's change our code to store the token and email in a session cookie instead of displaying them.

#### New version of `gettoken` action ####

```ruby
def gettoken
  token = get_token_from_code params[:code]
  session[:azure_token] = token.to_hash
  session[:user_email] = get_user_email token.token
  render text: "Access token saved in session cookie."
end
```

### Refreshing the access token

Access tokens returned from Azure are valid for an hour. If you use the token after it has expired, the API calls will return 401 errors. You could ask the user to sign in again, but the better option is to refresh the token silently.

In order to do that, the app must request the `offline_access` scope. Add this scope to the `SCOPES` array in `auth_helper.rb`:

```ruby
# Scopes required by the app
SCOPES = [ 'openid',
           'offline_access',
           'https://outlook.office.com/mail.read' ]
```

This will cause the token response from Azure to include a refresh token. Now let's add a helper method in `auth_helper.rb` to retrieve the cached token, check if it is expired, and refresh it if so.

#### `get_access_token` in the `.\o365-tutorial\app\helpers\auth_helper.rb` file ####

```ruby
# Gets the current access token
def get_access_token
  # Get the current token hash from session
  token_hash = session[:azure_token]

  client = OAuth2::Client.new(CLIENT_ID,
                              CLIENT_SECRET,
                              :site => 'https://login.microsoftonline.com',
                              :authorize_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize',
                              :token_url => '/common/oauth2/v2.0/token')

  token = OAuth2::AccessToken.from_hash(client, token_hash)

  # Check if token is expired, refresh if so
  if token.expired?
    new_token = token.refresh!
    # Save new token
    session[:azure_token] = new_token.to_hash
    access_token = new_token.token
  else
    access_token = token.token
  end
end
```

## Using the Mail API ##

Now that we can get an access token, we're in a good position to do something with the Mail API. Let's start by creating a controller for mail operations.

    rails generate controller Mail index

This is slightly different than how we generated the `Auth` controller. This time we passed the name of an action, `index`. Rails automatically adds a route for this action, and generates a view template.

Now we can modify the `gettoken` action one last time to redirect to the index action in the Mail controller.

### New version of `gettoken` action ###

```ruby
def gettoken
  token = get_token_from_code params[:code]
  session[:azure_token] = token.to_hash
  session[:user_email] = get_user_email token.token
  redirect_to mail_index_url
end
```

Now going through the sign-in process in the app lands you at http://localhost:3000/mail/index. Of course that page doesn't do anything yet, so let's fix that.

### Making REST calls ###

In order to make REST calls, install the [Faraday gem](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday). This gem makes it pretty simple to send and receive requests. Open up the `Gemfile` file and add this line anywhere in the file:

    gem 'faraday'

Save the file, run `bundle install`, and restart the server. Now we're ready to implement the `index` action on the `Mail` controller. Open the `.\o365-tutorial\app\controllers\mail_controller.rb` file and define the `index` action:

```ruby
class MailController < ApplicationController

  include AuthHelper

  def index
    token = get_access_token
    email = session[:user_email]
    if token
      # If a token is present in the session, get messages from the inbox
      conn = Faraday.new(:url => 'https://outlook.office.com') do |faraday|
        # Outputs to the console
        faraday.response :logger
        # Uses the default Net::HTTP adapter
        faraday.adapter  Faraday.default_adapter  
      end
      
      response = conn.get do |request|
        # Get messages from the inbox
        # Sort by ReceivedDateTime in descending orderby
        # Get the first 20 results
        request.url '/api/v2.0/Me/Messages?$orderby=ReceivedDateTime desc&$select=ReceivedDateTime,Subject,From&$top=20'
        request.headers['Authorization'] = "Bearer #{token}"
        request.headers['Accept'] = 'application/json'
        request.headers['X-AnchorMailbox'] = email
      end
      
      # Assign the resulting value to the @messages
      # variable to make it available to the view template.
      @messages = JSON.parse(response.body)['value']
    else
      # If no token, redirect to the root url so user
      # can sign in.
      redirect_to root_url
=======
    class MailController < ApplicationController

      def index
    	token = session[:azure_access_token]
		email = session[:user_email]
    	if token
	      # If a token is present in the session, get messages from the inbox
	      conn = Faraday.new(:url => 'https://outlook.office.com') do |faraday|
		    # Outputs to the console
		    faraday.response :logger
		    # Uses the default Net::HTTP adapter
		    faraday.adapter  Faraday.default_adapter
	      end

	      response = conn.get do |request|
		    # Get messages from the inbox
		    # Sort by ReceivedDateTime in descending orderby
		    # Get the first 20 results
		    request.url '/api/v2.0/Me/Messages?$orderby=ReceivedDateTime desc&$select=ReceivedDateTime,Subject,From&$top=20'
		    request.headers['Authorization'] = "Bearer #{token}"
		    request.headers['Accept'] = 'application/json'
		    request.headers['X-AnchorMailbox'] = email
	      end

		  # Assign the resulting value to the @messages
		  # variable to make it available to the view template.
	      @messages = JSON.parse(response.body)['value']
	    else
	      # If no token, redirect to the root url so user
	      # can sign in.
	      redirect_to root_url
	    end
	  end

    end
  end
end
```

To summarize the code in the `index` action:

- It creates a connection to the Mail API endpoint, https://outlook.office.com.
- It issues a GET request to the URL for inbox messages, with the following characteristics:
	- It uses the [query string](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/APi/complex-types-for-mail-contacts-calendar#UseODataqueryparameters) `?$orderby=ReceivedDateTime desc&$select=ReceivedDateTime,Subject,From&$top=20` to sort the results by `ReceivedDateTime`, request only the `ReceivedDateTime`, `Subject`, and `From` fields, and limit the results to the first 20.
	- It sets the `Authorization` header to use the access token from Azure.
	- It sets the `Accept` header to signal that we're expecting JSON.
	- It sets the `X-AnchorMailbox` header to the user's email address. Setting this header allows the API endpoint to route API calls to the appropriate backend mailbox server more efficiently.
- It parses the response body as JSON, and assigns the `value` hash to the `@messages` variable. This variable will be available to the view template.

### Displaying the results ###

Now we need to modify the view template associated with the `index` action to use the `@messages` variable. Open the `.\o365-tutorial\app\views\mail\index.html.erb` file, and replace its contents with the following:

#### Contents of the `.\o365-tutorial\app\views\mail\index.html.erb` file ####

```erb
<h1>My messages</h1>
<table>
  <tr>
  <th>From</th>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Received</th>
  </tr>
  <% @messages.each do |message| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= message['From']['EmailAddress']['Name'] %></td>
    <td><%= message['Subject'] %></td>
    <td><%= message['ReceivedDateTime'] %></td>
  </tr>
  <% end %>
</table>
```

The template is a fairly simple HTML table. It uses embedded Ruby to iterate through the results in the `@messages` variable we set in the `index` action and create a table row for each message. The syntax to access the values of each message is straightforward. Notice the way that the display name of the message sender is extracted:

```erb
<%= message['From']['EmailAddress']['Name'] %>
```

This mirrors the JSON structure for the `From` value:

```json
"From": {
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.OutlookServices.Recipient",
  "EmailAddress": {
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.OutlookServices.EmailAddress",
  "Address": "jason@contoso.com",
  "Name": "Jason Johnston"
  }
}
```

Save the changes and sign in to the app. You should now see a simple table of messages in your inbox.

## Next Steps ##

Now that you've created a working sample, you may want to learn more about the [capabilities of the Mail API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/APi/mail-rest-operations). If your sample isn't working, and you want to compare, you can download the end result of this tutorial from [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonjoh/o365-tutorial).

# first, we save users and produce an auth token

# next we output ical feeds with the token
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/calendar-rest-operations#Getevents
we want the fellowshipcal@robinhood and person's calendar
# next we add an smtp and imap server:
